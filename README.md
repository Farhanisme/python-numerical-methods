# Python Numerical Methods

This repository contains Python implementations of several fundamental numerical methods for finding the roots of a function. The methods are provided as individual scripts for clarity and ease of use.

## Methods Included

* **`bisection.py`**: An implementation of the Bisection Method, a bracketing method for finding the root of a function by repeatedly bisecting an interval.
* **`newtonraphson.py`**: An implementation of the Newton-Raphson Method, an iterative method that uses the tangent line to approximate the function's root.
* **`regula-falsi.py`**: An implementation of the Regula-Falsi (False Position) Method, a root-finding algorithm that combines the Bisection and Secant methods.
* **`secant.py`**: An implementation of the Secant Method, a root-finding algorithm that is a variation of the Newton-Raphson method, using a secant line instead of a tangent.

## How to Use

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine.

2.  **Navigate to the Directory**:
    Open your terminal and navigate to the `numeric-method` directory.

3.  **Run the Script**:
    Each script can be run individually from the command line using the Python interpreter. For example, to run the Bisection Method:
    ```bash
    python bisection.py
    ```

    You may need to inspect the script's code to adjust the function and initial parameters as needed for your specific problem.
